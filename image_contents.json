This pose is a foundational standing pose that stretches the entire back side of the body, from the shoulders to the heels. It is often used as a warm-up or cool-down pose and can be modified to suit different levels of flexibility. In this pose, the arms are typically extended forward and the head is dropped, allowing the chest to open and the spine to lengthen. The legs are straight, with weight evenly distributed between both feet. This pose can help improve flexibility, balance, and overall posture."
